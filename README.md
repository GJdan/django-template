# Django Template

A basic template for a django project.  This template does not currently assist with packaging or deployment.

Note: This is not a tutorial.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing
purposes.

### Prerequisites

There are not many prerequisites for this template.  I recommend python3 with virtualenv.  Also NodeJS 6.4.11 if you
intend to use a ReactJS frontend.

A great way to install NodeJS is using the nodesource distributions here: https://github.com/nodesource/distributions
